<h2> About me</h2>
 <p> I moved over to the United Kingdom in December 2016. Originally it was looking
to be a working holiday, I work for 6 months then travel throughout Europe. As 
the months went by I found myself really enjoying life to its full potential. I was
happy with the person I become.

<h2> My ability in Photography</h2>
 <p> Photography was no easy hobby to take up. It's incredibly daunting trying to find
 what equipment is most suitable for a beginner. There is millions of reviews and opinions out there
 which makes it hard for an indecisive person such as myself. I went with the Nikkon D3300, It was the
 most recommended camera by the vast majority which now, i completely agree. Another daunting task was
 trying to find the right camera lens. Again, i ended up going with the most recommended which was the 
 35mm f 1.8g lens.</p>
